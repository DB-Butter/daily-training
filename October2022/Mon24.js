// Monday October 24, 2022. Challenge: easy.

// Challenge:
// Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
// You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
// You can return the answer in any order.

// myAnswer:

// create a function which accepts an array of numbers, and a target number

// create a for loop which iterates over the array

// create a nested for loop which checks if [i] + [j] = target number

//return result
